## Calm Quadrant – What helps me relax?

When I'm in the calm zone, I like doing things that bring inner peace and reset my mind.  
My go-to calm activities are:

- Listening to soft or peaceful music  
- Taking solo walks, especially in the evenings  
- Reading something that inspires me  
- Sitting quietly or doing short meditation  
- Spending quiet time without distractions

These help me feel mentally clear and refreshed.

## Stress Quadrant – When do I feel stressed?

I usually slip into the stress zone when:

- Deadlines are too close  
- Interviews or technical reviews are coming up  
- I'm learning tough topics without proper breaks  
- I'm juggling too many things at once or multitasking too much

When I realize this early, I take a pause and shift myself back into calm mode.

## Excitement Quadrant – When do I feel fully energetic?

I know I’m in the excitement zone when:

- I’m learning something interesting and understanding it well  
- I’m focused while solving coding problems or building something  
- I’m seeing clear progress in my learning or projects  
- I’m discussing or teaching something I’ve recently learned

In these moments, I feel energetic, focused, and genuinely happy.
