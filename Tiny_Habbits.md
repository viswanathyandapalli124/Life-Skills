# Tiny Habits – My Notes

## 1. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg

**What I liked most:**  
The best idea I learned is starting small. For example, just floss one tooth or do one push-up. It sounds funny but it actually works. Small habits are easier to start, and once I start, I usually do more.

## 2. Main Idea from Tiny Habits

**B = MAP formula:**  
This means:  
- **B** = Behavior  
- **M** = Motivation  
- **A** = Ability  
- **P** = Prompt  

A habit happens when these 3 things come together. So, instead of waiting for motivation, I should make the habit easy and use a clear prompt (like a routine I already do).

**Why celebration is important:**  
Celebrating a small success makes me feel good. That feeling helps me want to do the habit again. BJ Fogg says, “Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.” I agree with that now.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

**What I liked most:**  
The idea of getting just 1% better every day is powerful. I liked the story about how the British cycling team improved little by little and became champions. This showed me that small changes add up to big results.

## 4. Atomic Habits – My Notes

**Identity is the key:**  
Instead of saying “I want to read,” I now say “I am a reader.” When I believe I am that kind of person, it’s easier to build habits that match that identity.

**How to make a habit easier:**  
Make it simple. For example, keep the book on the desk or wear workout clothes ahead of time. Start with just 2 minutes—this helps me begin without stress.

**How to make a bad habit harder:**  
I try to make bad habits less convenient. Like, I removed apps or keep junk food out of sight. If something is harder to do, I’m less likely to do it.

## 5. My Habits

### Habit I want to build: Reading every day  
- Honestly, I don’t always read every day, but I’m trying to.
- I keep the book nearby, so it reminds me to open it at least once.
- Even if I read just 1-2 pages, I feel like I did something.
- I'm not consistent with marking anything, but I do feel good when I actually finish a small section.

### Habit I want to stop: Checking phone in the morning  
- I switched off my phone.  
- I use a normal alarm clock.  
- I feel more relaxed in the morning without the phone. That keeps me motivated.

### ## Final Thoughts

Right now, I’m not perfect. But I’ve started. I’m not waiting for motivation. I’m focusing on making things **easy**, **obvious**, and **small**. If I can do something daily—even for 2 minutes—I know it will grow with time.
