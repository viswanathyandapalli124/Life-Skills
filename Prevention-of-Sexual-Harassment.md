##  What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome or inappropriate actions, such as:

- Making sexual jokes or comments  
- Repeatedly asking for dates despite being rejected  
- Staring, leering, or making suggestive gestures  
- Unwanted physical contact like touching, hugging, or brushing  
- Sharing or sending explicit messages or images  
- Showing sexual content without consent  
- Spreading rumors about someone’s personal life  
- Making someone feel uncomfortable through body language or remarks  

These actions can be:

And may occur in person or through digital platforms (e.g., chats, emails, social media).

##  What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would:

- Stay calm and ensure personal safety  
- Speak up or say “no” clearly (if I feel safe doing so)  
- Note down the details (date, time, location, people involved, what happened)  
- Report the incident to the Internal Committee (IC) or HR, as per the PoSH policy  
- Encourage others to speak up if they are affected  
- Support the person who is facing harassment  
- Avoid ignoring the issue, even if it seems minor

Taking action ensures that the workplace remains safe, inclusive, and respectful for everyone.
